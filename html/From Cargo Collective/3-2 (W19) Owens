<p>An·thro·po·cene: (n.) the current geological age, viewed as the period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment.</p><p>If taken in the guise of a layered investigative set of terms which determine what is architectural, or anthropocentric, the lens by which to capture these motives harkens a hyper-contextual divisibility of layers at play to thereby ascribe the image onto the object of interest; which is, perhaps, an act of dismay. Fingerprints to fresh glass; a depletion of an untouched, authentic array of meaning -- of once existing.</p><p>Our investigation involved utilizing the lens of our given factions of the time, to capture, and instigate a knowledge of familiar and disparate terms regarding Owens Lake; into a reversion toward a presence of what is "unfound." -- by controlled and authored visual media, strictly.</p><p>By our 'dictive' measures of an 'architecturally academized langore' -- transplanted to a sensatorially pungent environment, then a transfering of the captured content to a post-production phasing of engrossing the proverbial dried film within a closed environment of discourse, we see what may lay fill -- to and of the land at which disorder, law, and the anthropocene lays, currently, at a tranquil and constant "still".</p><p>Neutralism: (n.) A policy towards political neutrality.</p>
