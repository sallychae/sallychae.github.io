<u>1.1 "1/2 of LADWP"</u>
{image 1}
Dimensions: ( __ x __ x __ )
Presentation: A Final rendering of the proposed design: to obfuscate the grid completely, and to impose strictly non-adhering geometries into a highly rigid original geometry.

<b>1.2 "A Gridded Matrix"</b>

<u>Model 2</u>
Dimensions: ( __ x __ x __ )
Presentation: The final proposed design: to obfuscate the appearance of the grid in plan, section and elevation; completely. Strictly non-adhering geometries will deploy within the highly rigid geometry of the original headquarters building.
Turnover (from File to Parts to Model): 3 days
