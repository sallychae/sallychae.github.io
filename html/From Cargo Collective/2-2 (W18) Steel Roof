<figcaption>Course Description: Studio, 12 hours; outside study, six hours. Requisite: course 414. Culmination of core sequence (courses 411 through 414), with focus on development phase of project. Technical concerns such as lighting, material innovation, sustainability, construction documents, and building envelopes to be considered critical to generation of architectural form, integrated in design of single building project. <!--Letter grading.--> (Taken from the WINTER 2018 MyUCLA Class Detail Desc.)<a href="https://files.cargocollective.com/561384/415_Sharif-Daly-Ickx-Mirzaeian_18W--Last-modified-18-01-4--08-46-.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a></figcaption>

<b>Elevation</b> tells the "-scape" addendum to the Roof of this project. The outline or "trace" made evident by an elevation might, when treated as a linear composition on its own, encourage an instigation of what steel framed rigidity can, topically, entail.

In <b>Section</b>, the building expresses differently in its long and short directions. The skeleton of the proposition of this project toward Steel Frame construction can be seen in this contrast. Long section remains slender, continuous and reliant on a slight angle to define its terminal directive toward the opposite end of the site boundary. Short section expresses a disparate, but self-implicating composition of roof openings and shut-off structure in an overall incongruency that resolves itself into a multi-angular roof.
