<b>Site: Elysian Valley, Frogtown, Los Angeles, CA</b>
&emsp;&emsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.0907798,-118.2426629,786a,35y,39.24t/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">Elysian Valley</a> holds a historically reclusive position just south of the industrial district of Little Tokyo, LA. Amid the tremors of the mid-century burgeoning  of landscaping freeways; and through other signs of a robustly developing LA; a spirit of consolidation fills Frog Town, as the namesake side-splash that it is today. A bi-annual district for artists, a year-round enclave along the proverbial river of a dry Los Angeles Strait, and a community of single-family homeowners or renters; abiding to the tides of a 'downtown-lateral' space; such is a sunny, drifted, and residually compounded into leftover city space.
