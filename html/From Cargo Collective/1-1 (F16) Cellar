<figcaption>Course Description: Studio, 12 hours; outside study, six hours. Introduction to sketching, drawing, perspectives, CAD. Architectural composition is initially studied in terms of its separate elements. After each is studied by means of manipulative exercise that allows for experimentation of its intrinsic possibilities, students undertake series of closely controlled exercises dealing with combining elements and then design small buildings. Letter grading.

The following is a form and concept study of a shed design. Using formal idiosyncrasies and vocabulary derived from the Ely Cathedral's Lady Chapel, I conjured a shed that would express itself and behave organically.

As fundamental a physical quality as "energy can neither be created nor destroyed" is derived from the vaulting character of the Ely Lady Cathedral.

From this, I assumed a shed in which its form, structure, and program would be shaped by this physical law. Where there is a push, there is a pull: resulting in spaces for particular program types or shelves for particular item types.

The shed is partly above and below ground, is built for year-long root vegetable storage. Made of a concrete shell and a both structural and performative internal skeleton, the shed intends to have been grown for its purpose.

<b>Final Model</b>

The Final Model is a 1/4"=1' scale, 3D Powder Printed model, in which the subterranean half is held by a CNC-Mill-produced foam nest.

The sectional model helps to visualize how the shed's whole or half is utilized formally and programmatically.
