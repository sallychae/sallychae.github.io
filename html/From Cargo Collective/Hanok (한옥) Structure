The "Hanok" is a traditional Korean House. The materials, motifs, organization, and engineering follow the original forms designed in the first Hanok buildings of the 14th C Josean Dynasty.

<!--Raw native materials such as soil, timber, rocks (constitute the foundation, columns and beams) & clay tiles (roof) make up the buildings. "Cheoma" refers to the edge of the Hanok's curvy roofs, and the lengths of them are adjusted to control the amount of sunlight to enter into the building.

In studying this raw and encapsulating formal ligature of this emblematic spoke of identity, --!>I began with iterations of the Hanok's wood frame structure, in its most elemental form and scale (3x2 column layout, at 1:16 scale, and with handcut balsawood square dowels)

Notches were of particular interest here. Let's begin with the rectangular column. An imaginary 3x3 grid is visualized looking down on the top-side of an erect rectangular wooden column. The inner square portions are removed, leaving behind the 4 squares on the corners. The signature column of a Hanok building stands as a 4-pronged square wooden column, set atop [and leveled with wooden wedges] a flattened stone of a greater width than the column.

This single piece is the central piece to a specific order of notching to take place among Hanok buildings. Beams and trusses become the next notched segments to slip into the inner notch of these pronged columns.

<i>"The pillars, rafters, doors, window frames, and floor are wooden, while the walls are a mixture of straw and dirt. The paper to cover the frames of doors and windows was made from tree pulp. As the building materials used are all natural, hanok houses have excellent breathability, perfect for escaping the summer heat."</i>

건축 학교 삼년째 시작 하기 전에 한국으로 여행을 갔습니다. 이번 여행에 한국 나라의 건축물과 역사에 대해 관심이 있었습니다. 서울와 경주로 갔습니다.

Before my third year of architecture school, I went on a trip to Korea. I was interested learning more about the architecture and history of Korea. I travelled to Seoul and Gyeongju.
