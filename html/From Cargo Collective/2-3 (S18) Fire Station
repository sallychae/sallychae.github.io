<figcaption>Course Description: Studio, 12 hours; outside study, six hours. Requisite: course 413. Designed for second-year graduate students. Introduction to issues such as programming and program manipulation, site planning, urban design, and integration of technical systems and architectural expression. Emphasis either on treatment in breadth of large-scale projects or exploration in depth and detail of smaller-scale projects. Students learn to integrate structure and environmental control and to present their ideas in graphic or model form.

<p>This studio begins with a precedent study on the gestural photomontage compositions produced by architectural artist, Filip Dujardin. Using neural network image programming to duplicate the renditioning of architectural imaging into a hyperreal whole; our studio aimed to reconsider the Architectural Elevation drawing as a basis from which to belabor organizational principles, wholes, and defining characteristics of a resultant Fire Station building.</p></head>

<body><p><b>Precedent</b>
A combination of photo-montage, rendering and a live "at-play" reality leads to a series of building images which, convincingly, propose a new but impossible reality. Constructed by Filip Dujardin, the images display buildings that take place in various environments; and that are made of multiple material qualities; but all operate under a believable degree of visible renditions of the laws of physics and/or building construction.

  The images suggest an 'other world' for which a deliberate and conglomerate modification to physicality, which alternatively produces a breathtaking composition of the suggested reality, can, by the degree of its imperceptible faux-joinery and impious need for notary, certainly exist. A balance of entirely digital media (no "demo" needed here) allows the once blunt reordering of cropped and layered, imaged building parts; into a gestural outcome of a starkly hyperreal reality. By select means, of parts of images are cut, set aside, and composed into a digital buoyancy toward an 'other' abiding physics. Techniques to hint realsim (such as shadowing), to the necessary degree by means to create this possible world; persist. These two techniques of imaging and splicing, together, maintain an image of architectural feasibility; cloaked over digital process, to construe what is other-ly & possible.</p>

The 110x340' lot provides a means to test the design possibilities for IFC/NFPA required 50' firetruck turning radius,</p>
<p><b>Ostogram</b>
  Using a Neural Network Imaging platform, we combine elements of existing images to produce combinations of visible characteristics; such as motion, resolution, composition, material, etc.; and reenact the organizing principles which Dujardin establishes to effectively create new otherworldly buildings.
  The approach aims to detach individual autonomy and towards a production of a self-identifying entity through image programming. The results below construe certain possibilities on the right hand column, produced by combinations of the two first columns, to thereby indicate possible generators for plan, elevation, quality and characteristics of a new possible Fire Station building.

The image conveys a ribboning quality of a non-flex, wooden material. The arraying but mis-aligning and curving alignment of the material units instigates continuity and self-governance of the ordering of this material. Holes in the pattern (in this case, dark windows) convey somewhat random interruption to the ribboning skin.</p>
<p><b>Principle</b>
Ribboning, flexing wood, deep apertures: what if the building were a wall?
{image 22}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b>Elevation</b>
The building elevation is fleshed. Coloration, motions and scale construe a self-governing motion of a materialized entity that further shall dictate its internal organizing principles.
{image 20}</p>
<p><b>Plan</b>
The centering tectonic behavior of study; of stagnancy given to moments of complexity; follows suit in plan. Floor-to-floor differentiation produces a motion picture effect of intrinsic formal behaviors made to confer migration of material and programmatic parts in sequence of elevation height.</p>
