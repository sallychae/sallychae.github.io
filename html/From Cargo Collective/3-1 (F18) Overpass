<u><b>1.0 Precedent Study: El Alto / La Paz, Bolivia; & Freddy Mamani</b></u>

The neighboring cities, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Paz,+Bolivia/@-16.5206654,-68.264507,57388m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x915edf0a04f5a40f:0x57dbfc76b4458ab3!8m2!3d-16.489689!4d-68.1192936" target="_blank">La Paz</a> and El Alto, buttress one another along the ridge of a dusty plateau; which peers over an undulous, dry valley. El Alto is the steadily growing city above; La Paz, the older town that cascades downhill from the flat land; both are covered end-to-end, on the traditional economy of, uniformly non-painted, red-brick and concrete, 2-3 story structures. At 15,000+ ft. above sea-level and a professed "Neo-Andean" architecture on the rise, the sided cities of brick are a backdrop for an emerging diorama of uninhibited cultural expression.

The studio focused precedent research on the "Neo-Andean" methods and forms designed by Bolivian Architect, Freddy Mamani Silvestre.

<u><b>1.1 Precedent Study: Traveling to Bolivia, and Meeting Freddy Mamani</b></u>

Amidst the undulous plateau-siding landscape of La Paz, and atop the expanding flat-plane sector of El Alto, his distinctively colorful and picturesque armada of structures "[are] altering the landscape of El Alto. Their ornamented and brightly colored facades slowly replacing cinder block and tin-roof structures and contrasting with the snowcapped peaks overlooking the city." - Andres Schipani, (<font size="1/2">"Bolivia's Indigenous People Flaunt Their Newfound Wealth," <i>The Financial Times</i>, 2014.</font>)

Research and study of the topic led to the following design studio agenda: to challenge the facade, program and tectonic make-up of the plynthe-to-highrise architectural ant-hill; Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, CA.

<u><b>1.2 Precedent Study 2: Bunker Hill, Los Angeles, CA</b></u>

Once slope-ful's of upper-middle class single-family Victorian homes abutting the historic park center of LA City Hall; and later a multi-million landscape project, evicting homes and pulling levels of dirt from its hills; like cake slabs from a convection oven; to a current leftover topological irregularity that no heaped and measured and some even say sculptured, or carved, mass of concrete couldn't, for circulation's sake, infiltrate to correction. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bunker+Hill,+Los+Angeles,+CA/@34.0402202,-118.2568359,1957a,35y,38.93t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2c64d4ba587c1:0x2788ac2eeaccbf13!8m2!3d34.0545476!4d-118.2512004" target="_blank">Bunker Hill</a> is at once, a magnificent and scandalous plot of robustly altered land on which; now, some of the city's conventionally large-grossing companies, take rest.

<u><b>2.0 Design: "Overpasses Create Waste": And the Plinths Are No Exception.</b></u>

Residual and unusable urban footprints make up for a vast commonality of that which one recounts of their typically-vehicularized zoom through downtown Los Angeles.
